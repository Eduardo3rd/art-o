## Sketches

1. **Flow Field Study** - A Tyler Hobbs-inspired piece using flow fields and organic curves

## Running the Project

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser
   - For development, it's recommended to use a local server (e.g., Live Server in VS Code)
3. Navigate through the gallery to view individual pieces

## Adding New Sketches

1. Create a new directory under `sketches/` with a numbered prefix
2. Copy the basic structure from an existing sketch
3. Update the main `index.html` to include the new piece
4. Add documentation in the sketch's directory
