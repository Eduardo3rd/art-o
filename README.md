# Art-o: Generative Art with p5.js

This is a creative coding project using p5.js for generating art.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser
   - For development, it's recommended to use a local server (e.g., using Visual Studio Code's Live Server extension)

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - Main HTML file
- `style.css` - Styling for the canvas and page
- `sketch.js` - p5.js sketch code where the art is generated

## Getting Started

The canvas is set up with an 800x800 pixel size. You can modify the dimensions in `sketch.js`.
Write your generative art code in the `draw()` function in `sketch.js`.
